Evolutionary Ultimatum Game

The code files required to recreate the results recorded in the "Fairness in the Dictator Game with Edge Weight Learning" paper are DGAlgorithmPaper1.java and Player.java. These files are located in the src folder. 

To run the algorithm, execute the DGAlgorithmPaper1.java file. In DGAlgorithmPaper1.main(), assign parameter values (runs, ROC, rows, gens and EPR) and choose whether to run an experiment or an experiment series. If experiment series, choose which parameter you wish to varying across the series. An simple example of an experiment series is to run 5 experiments with the settings runs=1000, ROC=0.1, rows=10, gens=10000 and EPR=5, with ROC varying by 0.005 per experiment.
